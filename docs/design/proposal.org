* RSong-proxy
** Issues
*** slow response time for song and art assets
*** memory related issues.
*** problems get worse as we put more load on the system
** Proposal
*** run on 2 instances of rNode
**** user-data & asset metadata 
***** accessed more frequently
***** need to have faster response time
***** user facing rsong-proxy may interface with rNode for this data thru GRPC
**** Songs and artwork
***** large payloads
***** accessed less frequently
***** push these assets to redis cache
***** rsong-proxy will interface with redis to serve these large binary files
